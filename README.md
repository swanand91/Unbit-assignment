Unbit assignment
1 . Given an array of integers and a target value, you must determine which two integers' sum
equals the target and return a 2D array. Then merge the array into a single array with sorting (
ascending ) order, in the next step double the target value and find again the combination of
digits (can be multiple digits ) that are equal to the double targeted value and returned into a 2D
array.
Sample Input : [1, 3, 2, 2, -4, -6, -2, 8];
Target Value = 4,
Output: First Combination For “4” : [ [1,3],[2,2],[-4,8],[-6,2] ];
Merge Into a single Array : [-6,-4,1,2,2,2,3,8];
Second Combination For “8” : [ [ 1,3,2,2], [8,-4,2,2],....,[n,n,n,n] ]
